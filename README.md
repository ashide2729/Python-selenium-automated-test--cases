# Python-selenium-automated-test--cases
The repo contains source files to understand and implement automation testing using Python and Selenium.

#### To get started:

* Clone the project
* Specify the correct path for the chromedriver you downloaded for your respective chrome version
* Run the file and in not time you will see the test running on the chrome window

#### What next:

That is it what you need to know about automating testing using Python and Selenium on the Beginner level front.

You should always explore and learn more about automation testing, python, selenium, their syntaxes and implementation to work on creating more complex test cases for larger applications.

Here are few paths you can follow to learn more:
* Making use of different ways to interact with an element
* Different actions that we can perform on the elements like click, double click, scroll etc.
* Extracting data from DOM elements and doing data validation
* Running test cases as modules
* Running test cases in different browsers 
* Running tests using TestNG to generate reports
* Running tests headlessly(specifying driver properties to run the tests in the background inside the browser)
